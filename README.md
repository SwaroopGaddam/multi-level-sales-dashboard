## 🛠 Workflow

This workflow provides an interactive walkthrough of the multi-level sales analysis:
1. **Dashboard Navigation**:
   - The final story consists of three key dashboards:  
     ➡️ National-Level Sales Overview  
     ➡️ Channel-Level Sales Performance  
     ➡️ Format-Level Analysis
   - Use the navigation buttons or arrows to move between different slides.

2. **Year Filtering**:
   - A dynamic filter allows to select one or multiple years.
   - By adjusting the filter, all visualizations automatically update to show sales trends for the selected year(s).

3. **Interactive Exploration**:
   - Hover over charts to view detailed tooltips.
   - Analyze and compare performance across national, channel, and format levels.
   - Understand seasonal patterns through yearly and monthly breakdowns.

The Story approach ensures a logical flow, helping to gain layered insights step-by-step — from the national summary down to detailed channel and format-level trends.
